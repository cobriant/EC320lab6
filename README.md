# EC320 lab 6

In this lab, you'll learn a little about typesetting math using LaTeX, and then you'll do a short data project on Love Island, practicing dplyr, ggplot, and lm.

There are no tests for these assignments and there is no video to watch. Come to office hours with questions (Wednesday 4-5:20 and Friday 8-9am) and make sure to upload your html versions of both LaTeX.R and love_island.R to Canvas before Friday at 5pm.
